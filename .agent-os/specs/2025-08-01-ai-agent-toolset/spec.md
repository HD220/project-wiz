# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI Agent Tool-Set with AI SDK Integration
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Develop a comprehensive tool-set for AI agents using Vercel AI SDK's tool calling capabilities, providing agents with structured interfaces to interact with repositories, manage jobs, access platform features, and execute development tasks. This creates a standardized, type-safe toolkit that enables agents to perform complex software development workflows through well-defined tool interfaces.

## User Stories

### Comprehensive Development Tools

As an AI agent executing development tasks, I want access to a complete set of tools for file operations, git commands, repository analysis, and platform interaction, so that I can autonomously handle complex software development workflows without external dependencies.

The tool-set should provide structured interfaces for common development operations: reading/writing files, executing git commands, analyzing code structures, managing dependencies, running tests, and interacting with the Project Wiz platform itself.

### Type-Safe Tool Integration

As the system, I want all agent tools to be fully type-safe with proper validation and error handling, so that tool usage is predictable, debuggable, and maintains system stability even when agents make incorrect tool calls.

Each tool should have comprehensive TypeScript types, input validation with Zod schemas, structured error responses, and detailed logging to enable effective debugging and monitoring of agent behavior.

### Platform Integration Tools

As an AI agent, I want tools to interact with Project Wiz platform features (projects, channels, messages, jobs), so that I can coordinate with other agents, update project status, and manage my own execution context within the platform ecosystem.

Platform tools should enable agents to query project information, send messages to channels, update job status, coordinate with other agents, and access user preferences and configuration data.

## Spec Scope

1. **File System Tools** - Read, write, create, delete, and analyze files within agent workspace context
2. **Git Operation Tools** - Execute git commands, manage branches, commits, and repository state
3. **Code Analysis Tools** - Parse, analyze, and understand code structures, dependencies, and patterns
4. **Platform Integration Tools** - Interact with Project Wiz features (projects, channels, messages, jobs)
5. **Development Environment Tools** - Package management, testing, building, and deployment operations

## Out of Scope

- External API integration tools (third-party services)
- Advanced IDE features (debugging, profiling)
- Visual/UI manipulation tools
- System administration tools (beyond development needs)
- Direct database access tools (use platform APIs instead)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete Tool-Set** - Comprehensive collection of tools covering all major development and platform operations
2. **Type-Safe Integration** - Full TypeScript support with Zod validation and structured error handling
3. **Agent-Ready Implementation** - Tools properly integrated with generateText/generateObject for immediate agent use
