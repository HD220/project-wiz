# Spec Tasks

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Event Bus Infrastructure Extension
  - [ ] 1.1 Audit current event bus implementation and SystemEvents interface
  - [ ] 1.2 Design and implement new task-related event types (task-queued, task-started, task-progress, task-completed, task-failed, task-cancelled)
  - [ ] 1.3 Add task correlation ID system for event tracking
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement event bus stress testing to ensure performance under high load
  - [ ] 1.5 Add event bus metrics and monitoring capabilities
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify event bus integration maintains existing AI worker functionality

- [ ] 2. Core Background Task System Implementation
  - [ ] 2.1 Audit existing QueueClient implementation for patterns and reusable components
  - [ ] 2.2 Design and implement generic TaskQueue class with priority-based execution
  - [ ] 2.3 Create TaskRegistry for centralized task type definitions and metadata
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement TaskExecutor wrapper with progress reporting and error handling
  - [ ] 2.5 Add task lifecycle management (creation, execution, completion, cleanup)
  - [ ] 2.6 Implement concurrency control and resource management
  - [ ] 2.7 Add task cancellation and timeout handling mechanisms
  - [ ] 2.8 Verify task system integration with existing worker thread patterns

- [ ] 3. IPC Handler Migration Framework
  - [ ] 3.1 Audit current IPC handlers to identify long-running operations (>2 seconds)
  - [ ] 3.2 Design AsyncIpcHandler utility with intelligent routing (sync vs async)
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement task timeout detection and automatic background routing
  - [ ] 3.4 Create migration helpers for converting existing synchronous handlers
  - [ ] 3.5 Add progress broadcasting mechanism from tasks to renderer process
  - [ ] 3.6 Implement error handling and retry logic for async operations
  - [ ] 3.7 Create comprehensive testing framework for async IPC patterns
  - [ ] 3.8 Verify migrated handlers maintain full backward compatibility

- [ ] 4. Built-in Task Type Implementation
  - [ ] 4.1 Audit codebase for common long-running operation patterns
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement file-operations task type (file I/O, directory scanning)
  - [ ] 4.3 Create database-operations task type (complex queries, migrations)
  - [ ] 4.4 Add analysis-operations task type (code analysis, project scanning)
  - [ ] 4.5 Implement external-api task type for third-party service calls
  - [ ] 4.6 Create task type validation and metadata enforcement
  - [ ] 4.7 Add task type documentation and usage examples
  - [ ] 4.8 Verify all task types integrate properly with progress reporting

- [ ] 5. Integration Testing and Performance Optimization
