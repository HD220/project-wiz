# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Event Bus Background Task Architecture
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the main process IPC architecture to maximize event bus usage for background task decoupling, enabling long-running operations to process asynchronously without blocking the frontend. This creates a production-ready, scalable event-driven architecture that supports task queuing, progress tracking, and graceful error handling.

## User Stories

### Asynchronous Task Execution

As a developer using Project Wiz, I want long-running operations (like file operations, database migrations, code analysis) to run in the background without freezing the UI, so that I can continue working while tasks complete asynchronously.

The system should immediately acknowledge task initiation, provide real-time progress updates through the event bus, and notify completion with results. Tasks that take more than 2 seconds should automatically be routed to background processing with appropriate user feedback.

### Task Queue Management

As the application, I want to queue and prioritize background tasks efficiently, so that the system remains responsive under heavy load and tasks execute in optimal order.

The task queue should support priority levels, retry mechanisms, concurrency limits, and graceful shutdown. Users should see queue status and be able to cancel pending tasks when needed.

### Real-time Progress Tracking

As a user, I want to see live progress updates for long-running tasks, so that I understand what's happening and can estimate completion time.

Progress updates should include percentage completion, current operation description, and estimated time remaining. The UI should reflect these updates in real-time without polling.

## Spec Scope

1. **Event Bus Extension** - Expand SystemEvents with background task event types and standardized task lifecycle events
2. **Background Task Queue** - Implement a generic task queue system separate from the LLM-specific queue
3. **Task Registry Pattern** - Create a centralized registry for task types with metadata and execution handlers  
4. **IPC Handler Migration** - Convert synchronous IPC handlers to async event-driven pattern with timeout detection
5. **Progress Broadcasting** - Standardized progress reporting system using event bus for real-time UI updates

## Out of Scope

- Worker thread pool management (use existing patterns)
- Database schema changes (use existing task tracking if needed)
- Frontend UI components for progress display
- Task persistence across app restarts
- Advanced scheduling features (cron-like)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Responsive UI during heavy operations** - Frontend remains interactive while background tasks execute
2. **Real-time task progress** - Live progress updates visible in UI without performance impact
3. **Graceful error handling** - Failed tasks notify users with actionable error messages and retry options
