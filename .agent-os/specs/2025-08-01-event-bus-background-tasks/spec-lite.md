# Spec Summary (Lite)

Transform the main process to maximize event bus usage for background task decoupling, enabling long-running operations to process asynchronously without blocking the frontend. This creates a scalable event-driven architecture with task queuing, real-time progress tracking, and graceful error handling for production-ready asynchronous task execution.
