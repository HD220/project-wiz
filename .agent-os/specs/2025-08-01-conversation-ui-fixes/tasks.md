## Completion Notes

All conversation UI fixes have been successfully implemented and tested:

1. **Modal Flow**: Fixed by enabling router invalidation (`invalidateRouter: true`)
2. **Real-time Updates**: Implemented optimistic UI with local state management and proper error handling
3. **Sidebar Layout**: Fixed overflow issues by removing ScrollArea (which applied `display: table`) and using native overflow
4. **Avatar Consistency**: Created shared utility functions for consistent avatar rendering
5. **Custom Scrolling**: Implemented ScrollArea for chat messages with proper height management
6. **Header Styling**: Updated to match sidebar theme consistency
7. **Selection Indicators**: Fixed positioning and z-index issues

Note: There may be additional overflow edge cases that could benefit from a larger refactoring, which will be addressed in a future spec.
