# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement autonomous background worker system that processes LLM requests through a task queue, enabling AI agents to work independently without blocking the UI. This system replaces direct LLM API calls with a queued architecture where background workers handle all AI processing and deliver results back to the interface asynchronously.
