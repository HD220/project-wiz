# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-31-autonomous-llm-worker/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Overview

- **BullMQ-Inspired Design**: Job queue system with dependency management and flexible job types
- **Worker Thread Pool**: Use Node.js worker_threads managed in-memory (no database persistence)
- **Job-Based Processing**: All work units are described as "jobs" with textual descriptions and data payloads
- **Dependency Management**: Jobs can depend on other jobs, enabling complex autonomous workflows
- **Provider Agnostic**: Support multiple LLM providers through existing provider system integration

### Job Queue System Specifications

- **Job Types**: Different named job types (e.g., "process_message", "analyze_requirements", "generate_code")
- **Flexible Priority**: Numeric priority system (higher number = higher priority)
- **Job Dependencies**: Parent-child job relationships with dependency counting
- **Status Lifecycle**: waiting → active → completed/failed (BullMQ-style states)
- **Job Data**: JSON payloads containing job descriptions and parameters
- **Progress Tracking**: 0-100 progress percentage for long-running jobs

### Worker Process Requirements (In-Memory Management)

- **Dynamic Pool**: Workers spawned/destroyed based on job queue depth
- **No Database Tracking**: Worker processes managed entirely in memory
- **Job Processing**: Workers poll for jobs matching their capabilities
- **Resource Isolation**: Each worker operates independently
- **Failure Recovery**: Failed jobs returned to queue, crashed workers respawned automatically

### LLM Integration Layer

- **Provider Abstraction**: Use existing LLM provider system with queue-aware wrapper
- **Request Batching**: Group multiple requests to same provider when possible for efficiency
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect provider rate limits at worker level, queue requests when limits reached
- **Streaming Support**: Support streaming responses with incremental result delivery
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation context across multiple worker processes

### Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: User messages processed within 2-5 seconds under normal load
- **Queue Throughput**: System must handle minimum 10 concurrent LLM requests
- **Memory Usage**: Worker pool should not exceed 500MB total memory footprint
- **CPU Utilization**: Workers should use available CPU cores efficiently without starving main thread
- **Database Performance**: Queue operations must not impact UI responsiveness

## External Dependencies

This specification uses existing system components and does not require new external dependencies:

- **Existing LLM Provider System** - Leverages current provider abstractions
- **SQLite + Drizzle ORM** - Uses existing database infrastructure
- **Node.js worker_threads** - Built-in Node.js module for background processing
- **Existing IPC System** - Uses current renderer-main communication patterns
