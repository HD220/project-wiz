# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Autonomous LLM Worker Integration  
> Created: 2025-07-31  
> Updated: 2025-08-01  
> Status: Architecture Finalized - Ready for Implementation

## Overview

Implement a centralized event-driven orchestration system that integrates AI worker processing with Project Wiz messaging platform. The system enables autonomous AI agent responses in conversations through a clean, agnostic worker integration that maintains existing architectural patterns while providing real-time AI capabilities.

## User Stories

### Autonomous Agent Conversations

As a user conversing with AI agents, I want agents to automatically respond to my messages with contextually appropriate responses, so that I can have natural, flowing conversations without manual intervention or UI blocking.

**Detailed Workflow:** User sends message in DM conversation → Message service publishes event → AgenticWorkerHandler creates job with complete conversation context → Worker processes using all available agent data → Agent response is automatically created and displayed in UI → Conversation continues naturally.

### Multiple Agent Collaboration  

As a project manager, I want multiple AI agents to participate in conversations intelligently, so that I can leverage different expertise areas and get comprehensive responses to complex questions.

**Detailed Workflow:** User sends message to conversation with multiple agents → System evaluates which agents should respond based on context and availability → Selected agents generate responses → Multiple agent responses appear in conversation → User can continue discussion with relevant agents.

### Graceful Error Handling

As a system user, I want the system to handle AI processing failures gracefully, so that temporary issues don't break my workflow and I receive appropriate feedback when problems occur.

**Detailed Workflow:** User sends message → Worker processing fails due to API issues → System creates error message from agent explaining the issue → Agent status is reset to available → User can retry or continue with alternative approaches.

## Spec Scope

1. **Event-Driven Orchestration** - Central AgenticWorkerHandler manages all worker communication through event bus
2. **Complete Data Preparation** - All database queries performed in main process before sending to worker
3. **Worker Result Processing** - Automatic creation of agent response messages from worker results  
4. **Agent Status Management** - Proper lifecycle management of agent busy/active states
5. **Real-time UI Updates** - Renderer notifications for conversation updates and cache invalidation

## Out of Scope

- Direct worker database access (worker only uses job data)
- Service registration patterns (AgenticWorkerHandler calls services directly) 
- Complex agent coordination logic (handled by worker processors)
- Database schema changes (uses existing table structures)
- Metrics and monitoring systems (basic logging only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Natural Agent Conversations** - Users receive automatic, contextual responses from AI agents in conversations
2. **Event-Driven Integration** - Services remain decoupled through clean event bus communication
3. **Worker System Agnosticism** - Worker system maintains complete independence from domain logic
4. **Real-time UI Experience** - Conversations update automatically when agents respond without manual refresh
