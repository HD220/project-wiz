# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Autonomous LLM Worker System
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement an autonomous background worker system that processes LLM requests through a task queue, enabling AI agents to work independently without blocking the UI or requiring direct user supervision. This worker system will handle all LLM communications asynchronously, ensuring scalable agent execution while maintaining system responsiveness and enabling true autonomous software development workflows.

## User Stories

### Background Agent Processing

As a user engaging with AI agents in conversations, I want agents to process my requests autonomously in the background, so that I can continue working while agents analyze requirements, generate responses, and execute tasks without freezing the interface.

**Detailed Workflow:** User sends a message in a DM or project channel → System queues the request with context → Worker picks up task → LLM processes request with full conversation history → Response is generated and delivered back to the UI → User sees the response appear naturally in the conversation flow.

### Autonomous Task Execution

As a development team manager, I want to delegate high-level intentions to AI agents and have them work independently, so that I can focus on strategic decisions while agents handle implementation details autonomously.

**Detailed Workflow:** User provides high-level task ("implement authentication") → System breaks down into actionable tasks → Multiple workers process different aspects → Agents coordinate through the queue system → Progress is reported back → Final implementation is delivered with documentation.

### Queue Management and Prioritization

As a system administrator, I want the worker system to intelligently prioritize and manage task queues, so that critical user interactions are processed first while background analysis tasks run efficiently without affecting performance.

**Detailed Workflow:** System receives multiple requests → Tasks are categorized by priority (user messages = high, analysis = medium, background optimization = low) → Workers process based on priority and available resources → System maintains fair processing while ensuring responsiveness.

## Spec Scope

1. **Asynchronous Task Queue** - Implement SQLite-based task queue with priority management and worker assignment
2. **Background Worker Processes** - Create Node.js worker threads that continuously process LLM requests without blocking main thread
3. **LLM Integration Layer** - Build queue-aware LLM service that supports multiple providers and handles retries/failures
4. **Real-time Result Delivery** - Implement IPC system to deliver worker results back to UI components seamlessly
5. **Worker Pool Management** - Create dynamic worker allocation based on system resources and task load

## Out of Scope

- Direct LLM API calls from renderer process (must go through queue)
- Synchronous LLM processing (all requests must be asynchronous)
- File system operations from workers (workers focus only on LLM processing)
- Complex multi-step workflows (initial version handles single LLM requests)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Queue-Based Chat Responses** - Users can send messages and receive AI responses without UI blocking
2. **Background Agent Processing** - Agents work autonomously on tasks while users continue other activities
3. **Scalable Worker Management** - System automatically manages worker resources based on load and system capabilities
