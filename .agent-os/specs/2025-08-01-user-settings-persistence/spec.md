# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: User Appearance Settings Database Persistence
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Investigate and migrate user appearance settings from localStorage to proper database persistence to ensure settings are maintained across devices, browser sessions, and application updates. This addresses data consistency issues and provides a foundation for future user preference expansion.

## User Stories

### Persistent Settings Across Sessions

As a user, I want my appearance preferences (theme, layout, UI customizations) to persist across all browser sessions and application restarts, so that I don't need to reconfigure my preferred interface every time I use the application.

Settings should be saved to the database immediately when changed and restored accurately when the application loads, maintaining consistency regardless of browser state or local storage limitations.

### Cross-Device Synchronization

As a user accessing Project Wiz from multiple devices or browsers, I want my appearance settings to be synchronized across all my sessions, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of where I access the application.

Database persistence enables settings to follow the user account rather than being tied to specific browser/device local storage, providing seamless experience across different access points.

### Reliable Settings Management

As the system, I want user settings to be managed through the same reliable database infrastructure used for other application data, so that settings have proper backup, consistency, and integrity guarantees.

Database storage provides transaction safety, foreign key relationships with user accounts, and integration with existing backup and recovery procedures unlike localStorage which is volatile and browser-dependent.

## Spec Scope

1. **Settings Audit** - Identify all appearance settings currently stored in localStorage
2. **Database Schema Design** - Create proper database schema for user settings storage
3. **Migration System** - Implement migration from localStorage to database with fallback handling
4. **Settings Service** - Create service layer for settings CRUD operations
5. **Frontend Integration** - Update frontend to use database-backed settings API

## Out of Scope

- Advanced settings management UI (settings remain as currently implemented)
- Settings versioning or rollback capabilities
- Settings export/import functionality
- Multi-user settings sharing or templates
- Real-time settings synchronization between active sessions

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Database-Persisted Settings** - All user appearance settings stored reliably in database
2. **Seamless Migration** - Existing user settings automatically migrated without data loss
3. **Improved Reliability** - Settings persist across browsers, devices, and application updates
