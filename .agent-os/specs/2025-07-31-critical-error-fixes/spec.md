# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Critical Error Fixes
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Resolve three critical production issues affecting user experience: database transaction errors in agent creation, unhandled promise rejections in conversation creation, and accessibility compliance violations in modal dialogs.

## User Stories

### Agent Creation Error Resolution

As a user creating new agents, I want the process to complete successfully without error toasts, so that I can confidently create agents knowing they were saved properly.

The current flow shows "Transaction function cannot return a promise" in toast notifications, but the agent does get created. This creates confusion and erodes user trust in the system reliability.

### Conversation Creation Stability

As a user creating new conversations, I want the process to work smoothly without backend errors, so that I can start conversations immediately without technical interruptions.

Currently, creating conversations triggers unhandled promise rejections in the main process, potentially causing system instability and poor user experience.

### Modal Accessibility Compliance

As a user with accessibility needs, I want all modal dialogs to be properly labeled for screen readers, so that I can navigate the interface effectively using assistive technologies.

Currently, all modals lack proper DialogTitle elements, violating WCAG accessibility standards and creating barriers for users with disabilities.

## Spec Scope

1. **Agent Creation Transaction Fix** - Investigate and resolve Drizzle ORM transaction function returning promises inappropriately
2. **Conversation Creation Error Handling** - Implement proper error handling for unhandled promise rejections in main process
3. **Modal Accessibility Implementation** - Add VisuallyHidden DialogTitle to all modal components for screen reader compliance
4. **Error Pattern Audit** - Quick audit to identify similar patterns and prevent future occurrences
5. **Toast Error System Review** - Ensure error toasts only show for actual failures, not successful operations

## Out of Scope

- New modal functionality or UI changes beyond accessibility fixes
- Database schema modifications
- Performance optimizations unrelated to the error fixes
- Complete error handling system redesign

## Expected Deliverable

1. Agent creation completes without showing error toasts when successful
2. Conversation creation works without generating unhandled promise rejections in main process
3. All modal dialogs include proper DialogTitle elements for accessibility compliance
4. Error handling patterns are consistent and follow best practices
5. System logs clearly distinguish between actual errors and successful operations
