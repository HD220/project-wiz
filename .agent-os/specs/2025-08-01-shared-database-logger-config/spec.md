> Spec: Shared Database and Logger Configurations
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement shared database and logger configurations between main and worker processes to eliminate code duplication and ensure consistent behavior across the entire Electron application. This feature will centralize configuration management and provide unified logging and database access patterns.

## User Stories

### Consistent Database Access

As a developer working on this codebase, I want unified database access patterns so that main and worker processes use identical configuration and behavior without duplicate code.

**Detailed Workflow:** Currently, both main and worker processes have separate database connection files with nearly identical configurations. This creates maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies. The shared configuration will provide a single source of truth for database setup, connection parameters, and Drizzle ORM configuration.

### Unified Logging System

As a developer debugging the application, I want consistent logging format and behavior across all processes so that I can easily trace issues and monitor system behavior from a single, coherent log stream.

**Detailed Workflow:** Currently, the main process uses Pino logger with structured logging, while the worker process relies on console.log statements. This makes debugging multi-process interactions difficult and provides inconsistent log formatting. The unified logger will ensure all processes use the same logging infrastructure.

### Centralized Configuration Management

As a system administrator or developer, I want centralized configuration for shared resources so that environment variables, connection strings, and system settings are managed in one place and consistently applied across all processes.

**Detailed Workflow:** Configuration values like database paths, log levels, and system settings should be defined once and shared across processes. This eliminates the risk of configuration drift and makes environment-specific deployments more reliable.

## Spec Scope

1. **Shared Database Configuration Module** - Create common database setup with identical connection parameters, pragma settings, and Drizzle ORM configuration for both processes
2. **Unified Logger System** - Implement shared logger configuration that provides consistent Pino-based logging across main and worker processes
3. **Common Configuration Utilities** - Develop shared utilities for environment variable handling and system configuration management
4. **Process-Specific Adapters** - Create lightweight adapters that allow each process to use shared configurations while maintaining their specific requirements
5. **Migration Strategy** - Plan migration from current duplicate configurations to shared system without breaking existing functionality

## Out of Scope

- Database schema changes or migrations
- Performance optimization of database queries
- Advanced logging features like log rotation or remote logging
- Configuration file format changes or new configuration sources
- Monitoring or alerting systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Shared database connections work identically** - Both main and worker processes connect to database with identical configuration and behavior
2. **Consistent logging format** - All log messages from both processes follow the same structured format with proper context information
3. **No code duplication** - Database and logger setup code exists in shared modules, not duplicated across processes
