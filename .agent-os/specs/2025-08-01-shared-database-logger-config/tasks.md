# Spec Tasks

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Create Shared Configuration Infrastructure
  - [ ] 1.1 Audit current database connection patterns in main and worker processes
  - [ ] 1.2 Create `src/shared/config/index.ts` with centralized environment variable handling
  - [ ] 1.3 Create `src/shared/database/config.ts` with unified database setup
  - [ ] 1.4 Create `src/shared/logger/config.ts` with Pino-based logger factory
  - [ ] 1.5 Verify shared modules work independently and export correct types

- [ ] 2. Migrate Main Process to Shared Configuration
  - [ ] 2.1 Audit current main process database and logger usage
  - [ ] 2.2 Update `src/main/database/connection.ts` to use shared database config
  - [ ] 2.3 Update main process logger imports to use shared logger config
  - [ ] 2.4 Test main process functionality with shared configurations
  - [ ] 2.5 Verify implementation maintains existing behavior and performance

- [ ] 3. Migrate Worker Process to Shared Configuration
  - [ ] 3.1 Audit current worker process database connection and console logging
  - [ ] 3.2 Update `src/worker/database/connection.ts` to use shared database config
  - [ ] 3.3 Replace console.log statements with shared logger throughout worker files
  - [ ] 3.4 Test worker process functionality with shared configurations
  - [ ] 3.5 Verify implementation maintains worker performance and job processing

- [ ] 4. Integration Testing and Cleanup
