> Spec: Worker Git Repository Management with Worktrees
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Design and implement a comprehensive git repository management system for the worker processes that handles repository cloning, git worktree orchestration, and isolated workspace management for concurrent task execution. This enables multiple agents to work on the same repository simultaneously without conflicts while maintaining proper git history and branch management.

## User Stories

### Isolated Repository Workspaces

As an AI agent executing code tasks, I want to work in an isolated git worktree environment, so that my changes don't interfere with other concurrent agents working on the same repository while maintaining full git functionality.

Each agent task should receive a dedicated worktree with the appropriate branch checked out, allowing independent file operations, commits, and git commands without affecting other active tasks or the main repository state.

### Automatic Repository Management

As the system, I want to automatically clone repositories when first needed and manage worktree creation/cleanup, so that agents always have access to clean, up-to-date repository workspaces without manual intervention.

The system should handle repository discovery from project metadata, perform initial clones, maintain repository updates, and orchestrate worktree lifecycle management with automatic cleanup to prevent disk space issues.

### Concurrent Task Execution

As the worker system, I want to support multiple agents working on different branches of the same repository simultaneously, so that complex multi-agent development workflows can execute in parallel without blocking each other.

Each task should get its own isolated worktree environment, potentially on different branches, with proper synchronization mechanisms to handle branch updates, merges, and conflict resolution when necessary.

## Spec Scope

1. **Repository Discovery and Cloning** - Detect git repository URLs from project metadata and perform initial clones to worker storage
2. **Git Worktree Management** - Create, manage, and cleanup isolated worktrees for each agent task execution
3. **Branch Orchestration** - Handle branch creation, switching, and synchronization across multiple worktrees
4. **Workspace Isolation** - Ensure complete file system isolation between concurrent agent tasks
5. **Cleanup and Resource Management** - Automatic cleanup of unused worktrees and repository maintenance

## Out of Scope

- Git credential management (assume repositories are public or credentials handled separately)
- Complex merge conflict resolution (agents handle conflicts or fail gracefully)
- Repository hosting or remote management
- Git hooks or advanced git features
- Cross-repository dependency management

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Isolated Agent Workspaces** - Each agent task operates in completely isolated git worktree environment
2. **Automatic Repository Management** - System handles cloning, updates, and worktree orchestration transparently
3. **Concurrent Task Support** - Multiple agents can work on same repository simultaneously without conflicts
