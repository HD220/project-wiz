# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Project Creation with Default Channel and Members
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance project creation workflow to automatically establish essential project structure including a default "general" channel and appropriate member assignments. This ensures every new project has immediate usability with proper channel organization and agent/user memberships configured correctly from the start.

## User Stories

### Complete Project Setup

As a user creating a new project, I want the system to automatically create a "general" channel and add me as a member, so that I have an immediate workspace to start collaborating without additional setup steps.

The project creation should establish a complete Discord-like workspace structure with the user as a project member, the general channel ready for use, and any default agents automatically configured for immediate interaction.

### Default Agent Integration

As a user, I want my default agent to be automatically added to new projects I create, so that I can immediately start conversations and task delegation without manual agent assignment.

The system should identify the user's default agent (if configured) and automatically add it as a project member with appropriate permissions, enabling seamless AI collaboration from project inception.

### Immediate Usability

As a user, I want newly created projects to be immediately functional for conversation and task management, so that there's no friction between project creation and productive work.

Projects should emerge from creation with all necessary relationships established: user membership, channel availability, agent assignment, and proper permission structures for immediate use.

## Spec Scope

1. **General Channel Auto-Creation** - Automatically create a "general" channel during project creation with appropriate default settings
2. **User Auto-Membership** - Add the creating user as a project member with appropriate permissions
3. **Default Agent Assignment** - Identify and add user's default agent (if exists) to the new project as a member
4. **Channel Member Assignment** - Add both user and default agent as members of the general channel
5. **Permission Configuration** - Set appropriate default permissions for user and agent in project and channel contexts

## Out of Scope

- Advanced channel creation (specialized channels beyond "general")
- Complex role/permission systems (use basic member permissions)
- Agent selection UI during project creation
- Bulk user invitation during creation
- Project templates with pre-configured channels

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional General Channel** - Every new project has an immediately usable "general" channel
2. **Complete Membership Setup** - User and default agent are properly configured as project and channel members
3. **Immediate Conversation Readiness** - Users can start conversations with agents immediately after project creation
