# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Code Organization & Visual Refinement
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Improve codebase organization patterns and enhance visual consistency across the Project Wiz interface to ensure maintainability and professional polish before implementing core AI worker functionality.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Improvement

As a developer working on Project Wiz, I want consistent code patterns and clear organization, so that I can efficiently navigate, understand, and extend the codebase.

This involves standardizing file structures, ensuring consistent naming conventions, optimizing import paths, and maintaining clean separation between main process and renderer logic.

### Visual Consistency Enhancement

As a user of Project Wiz, I want a polished and consistent interface, so that the application feels professional and trustworthy for managing autonomous software development.

This includes consistent spacing, typography, component styling, loading states, error handling, and responsive behavior across all interface elements.

## Spec Scope

1. **File Location Standardization** - Audit and organize all files according to feature-based architecture with consistent directory placement
2. **Implementation Pattern Consistency** - Ensure all features follow the same implementation patterns (service → handler → model → schema → types)
3. **Naming Convention Enforcement** - Standardize all file names, function names, component names, and variable names according to established conventions
4. **Data Flow Pattern Optimization** - Implement consistent data loading hierarchy (TanStack Router → TanStack Query → Local State) across all features
5. **Documentation Cleanup** - Remove outdated comments, update existing documentation, and ensure all code follows established patterns
6. **Import Path Optimization** - Standardize @/ absolute imports and eliminate relative path inconsistencies
7. **Component Pattern Consistency** - Verify all React components follow function declaration patterns with proper props destructuring
8. **Visual Design Polish** - Enhance spacing, typography, and component consistency across the interface
9. **Error Handling UI** - Implement consistent error states and loading indicators throughout the application

## Out of Scope

- New feature development or functionality changes
- Database schema modifications
- AI worker implementation (reserved for next phase)
- Performance optimizations beyond code organization

## Expected Deliverable

1. All files are properly located in feature-based directories with consistent naming conventions
2. Implementation patterns are standardized across all features (service → handler → model → schema → types flow)
3. All naming follows kebab-case for files, camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for components/types
4. Data flow consistently uses TanStack Router → TanStack Query → Local State hierarchy
5. Documentation is clean, up-to-date, and follows established patterns without outdated references
6. Codebase follows consistent file naming and organization patterns across all features
7. All imports use standardized @/ paths with no relative import inconsistencies
8. React components consistently use function declarations with proper TypeScript patterns
9. Interface demonstrates visual consistency in spacing, typography, and component styling
10. Error states and loading indicators are consistently implemented across all user flows
