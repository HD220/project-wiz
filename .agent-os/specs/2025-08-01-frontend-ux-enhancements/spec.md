## Overview

Implement comprehensive frontend user experience enhancements that address conversation management, real-time notifications, and data integration improvements. This feature set will complete the remaining frontend TODOs to provide a polished, professional user interface with proper conversation archiving controls, unread message indicators, real project data integration, and notification systems.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Conversation Management

As a user, I want to unarchive conversations that I previously archived, so that I can restore important conversations back to my active conversation list when needed.

**Workflow**: User views archived conversations → User clicks unarchive option from conversation dropdown menu → System moves conversation back to active state → User sees conversation in main conversation list with full functionality restored.

### Real-time Message Status Tracking

As a user, I want to see clear visual indicators for unread messages in conversations, so that I can quickly identify which conversations need my attention and prioritize my responses effectively.

**Workflow**: User receives new messages while away from conversation → System tracks unread status per conversation → User sees unread indicators (dots, counters) in conversation list → User opens conversation and system marks messages as read.

### Authentic Project Data Integration

As a project manager, I want to see real project members and agents in the interface instead of placeholder data, so that I can work with accurate information and manage my actual team effectively.

**Workflow**: User navigates to project areas → System loads actual project members from database → User sees real names, avatars, and status information → User can interact with actual team members and agents.

## Spec Scope

1. **Conversation Unarchive Functionality** - Complete implementation of unarchive capability with proper API integration and UI feedback
2. **Unread Message Logic** - Comprehensive unread message tracking with visual indicators and read status management
3. **Real Project Data Integration** - Replace all mock data with actual database-driven project member and agent information
4. **Notification System Enhancement** - Implement sidebar notification logic for real-time updates and status changes
5. **UI/UX Polish** - Ensure all interactions provide proper feedback, loading states, and error handling

## Out of Scope

- Major UI redesign or layout changes
- New conversation features beyond archiving/unarchiving
- Advanced notification preferences or settings
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Performance optimizations beyond standard best practices

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Unarchive System** - Users can successfully unarchive conversations through the UI with proper API calls and database updates
2. **Working Unread Indicators** - Visual unread message indicators appear correctly in conversation lists and update in real-time
3. **Real Data Integration** - All project areas display actual member and agent data from the database instead of mock information
4. **Active Notification System** - Sidebar shows real-time notifications for conversation updates, agent status changes, and system events
