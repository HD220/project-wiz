## Pitch

Project Wiz is an autonomous software engineering factory that helps programmers and development teams automate software creation by providing AI-powered development automation through natural language conversations.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Time-constrained Programmers**: Developers who need to accelerate their development workflow
- **Small to Medium Development Teams**: Teams seeking to multiply their development capacity through AI automation

### User Personas

**Busy Developer** (25-45 years old)

- **Role:** Full-stack Developer / Tech Lead
- **Context:** Managing multiple projects with limited time for implementation
- **Pain Points:** Manual coding tasks, repetitive development work, context switching between projects
- **Goals:** Automate routine development tasks, focus on high-level architecture decisions

**Development Team Lead** (30-50 years old)

- **Role:** Technical Manager / Product Owner
- **Context:** Overseeing development teams with tight deadlines
- **Pain Points:** Resource allocation, technical debt accumulation, managing development bottlenecks
- **Goals:** Scale team productivity, maintain code quality, deliver features faster

## The Problem

### Manual Development Overhead

Current software development requires extensive manual work for routine tasks like CRUD operations, UI implementation, and integration patterns. This creates bottlenecks and prevents teams from focusing on core business logic and innovation.

**Our Solution:** Autonomous AI agents that analyze requirements, plan implementation, and execute development tasks with minimal human oversight.

### Context Switching and Project Management

Developers constantly switch between different projects, losing context and productivity. Traditional project management tools don't understand technical implementation details.

**Our Solution:** Discord-like interface where each project has dedicated AI specialists that maintain context and execute work autonomously.

## Differentiators

### Autonomous Execution Model

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that require constant prompting, Project Wiz agents work independently after receiving high-level intentions. Users delegate tasks naturally: "Team, we need two-factor authentication" → System analyzes, plans, and executes autonomously.

### Specialized AI Team Approach

Rather than a single general AI, Project Wiz automatically recruits relevant specialist agents per project. Each agent has deep expertise in specific domains (frontend, backend, security, etc.) and collaborates in structured forums for complex problems.

### Exception-Based Management

Users monitor progress through activity dashboards without micromanagement, intervening only when exceptions occur. This enables true delegation rather than assisted development.

## Key Features
