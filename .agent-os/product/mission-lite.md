# Project Wiz Mission (Lite)

Project Wiz is an autonomous software engineering factory that helps programmers and development teams automate software creation by providing AI-powered development automation through natural language conversations.

Project Wiz serves time-constrained developers and small-to-medium development teams who need to scale their productivity without hiring more developers. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that require constant prompting, Project Wiz agents work independently after receiving high-level intentions, enabling true delegation through specialized AI teams that automatically recruit relevant expertise per project.
