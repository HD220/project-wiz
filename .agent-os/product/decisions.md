## 2025-07-30: Initial Product Planning - Agent OS Installation

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Project Wiz is positioned as an autonomous software engineering factory that enables programmers and development teams to delegate development work to specialized AI agents through natural language conversations, targeting time-constrained developers and small-to-medium development teams.

### Context

Existing AI coding assistants require constant prompting and micromanagement, creating overhead rather than true productivity gains. Developers need a system that can work autonomously after receiving high-level intentions, similar to delegating work to human team members but with AI specialists.

### Rationale

**Market Opportunity:**

- Growing demand for development productivity tools
- Inadequate solutions for autonomous development execution
- Proven interface pattern (Discord-like) for team collaboration

**Technical Foundation:**

- Existing Electron + React + TypeScript architecture provides solid foundation
- SQLite + Drizzle ORM enables local-first approach with enterprise scalability
- shadcn/ui component library accelerates UI development

**Competitive Advantage:**

- Autonomous execution vs. assisted development
- Specialized AI teams vs. single general AI
- Exception-based management vs. constant supervision

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Clear differentiation from existing AI coding tools
- Scalable architecture that can grow from individual to enterprise use
- Local-first approach provides security and performance benefits
- Discord-like interface leverages familiar user patterns

**Negative:**

- Complex AI orchestration system to implement
- Higher development complexity than simple AI assistant
- Need for sophisticated agent specialization and collaboration

## 2025-07-30: Technology Stack Confirmation

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Maintain current Electron + React + TypeScript + SQLite + Drizzle ORM technology stack for Project Wiz development.

### Context

Existing codebase has established patterns and significant implementation progress with current technology choices. Need to evaluate whether stack supports autonomous AI development requirements.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Web Application with Cloud Database**
   - Pros: Easier deployment, natural scalability, standard web patterns
   - Cons: Security concerns for AI agents, dependency on internet connectivity, complex user data management

2. **Native Desktop (Tauri + Rust)**
   - Pros: Better performance, smaller bundle size, modern technology
   - Cons: Complete rewrite required, less familiar technology, slower development

### Rationale

Current stack provides:

- **Security**: Local SQLite ensures sensitive AI conversations and code remain on user's machine
- **Performance**: WAL mode SQLite with Drizzle ORM provides excellent local performance
- **Productivity**: Existing 48+ shadcn/ui components and established patterns accelerate development
- **Flexibility**: Electron enables future cloud sync while maintaining local-first approach

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Leverage existing implementation and patterns
- Maintain development velocity
- Security and privacy advantages for AI development workflows
- Proven scalability path through existing enterprise Electron applications

**Negative:**

- Larger application bundle size compared to web or native alternatives
- Electron-specific deployment and distribution considerations
- Need to implement worker threads for AI processing

## 2025-07-30: Development Phase Priorities

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Focus current development phase on code organization, visual refinement, and foundational patterns before implementing AI worker system.

### Context

Codebase has basic interface implementations but requires polish and standardization before adding complex AI processing capabilities. Current state is foundational interface with room for improvement in visual design and code organization.

### Rationale

**Quality First Approach:**

- Solid foundation enables faster AI feature development
- Consistent patterns reduce cognitive load during complex AI implementation
- Visual polish improves user experience for AI interactions

**Technical Debt Prevention:**

- Remove incorrect JWT session references
- Standardize component patterns and naming
- Establish consistent data loading and state management patterns

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Clean, organized codebase for AI feature implementation
- Consistent user experience foundation
- Reduced technical debt before complex features

**Negative:**

- Delayed AI functionality implementation
- Potential user expectation management needed
