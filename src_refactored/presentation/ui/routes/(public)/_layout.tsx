// This defines the layout route for the '(public)' group.
// The path '/' within createFileRoute for a layout usually means it applies to its directory.
// For a group layout `(public)/_layout.tsx`, TanStack Router's generator handles the path implicitly.
// Providing an explicit path like `/(public)/_layout` in createFileRoute can sometimes be necessary
// if the generator isn't perfectly inferring, but often just `component` is enough for layouts.
// However, to be explicit and align with potential strict generation:
export const Route = createFileRoute('/_layout')({
  // Note: The path for `createFileRoute` within a group layout `(group)/_layout.tsx`
  // should typically be just `/` if it's meant to be the layout for that group,
  // or it might be specific if this layout itself has a path segment *within* the group.
  // Given it's `_layout.tsx`, it's defining the layout for the `(public)` group itself.
  // The TanStack Router docs suggest that for a layout route file like `posts/_layout.tsx`,
  // you'd use `createFileRoute('/posts/_layout')`.
  // So for `(public)/_layout.tsx`, `createFileRoute('/(public)/_layout')` is appropriate.
  // Let's use the path that matches its file system location relative to the routes root.
  // The generator will handle the `(public)` part not being in the URL.
