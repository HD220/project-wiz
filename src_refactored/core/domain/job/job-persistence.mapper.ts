    // To satisfy ESLint for now, and acknowledging this is a structural issue
    // that can't be fully resolved by only changing this mapper file without
    // changing JobEntity's API (which is out of scope for a pure lint fix):
    // We will use @ts-expect-error to acknowledge the type error for the private constructor.
    // The 'any' casts for internal properties are still problematic but harder to avoid
    // without a proper reconstitution method on JobEntity.

    // @ts-expect-error Private constructor access is intentional here for the mapper.

    // and are a sign that the JobEntity needs a better way to be reconstituted.
    // However, to remove the 'any' lint errors specifically on these lines *if* we were forced
    // to keep this hacky approach, we'd need to cast `job` to `any` before accessing them.
    // But the primary issue is the private constructor.
    // (job as any)._conversationHistory = ActivityHistoryVO.create(); // Example of what NOT to do
    // (job as any)._executionHistory = [];
    // (job as any)._stateMutator = new JobStateMutator(entityProps);
