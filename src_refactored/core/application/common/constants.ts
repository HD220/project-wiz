// Note: Ensure these symbols match the ones used in the InversifyJS bindings in the infrastructure layer.
// The infrastructure layer will bind concrete implementations to these application/domain defined symbols.
// This keeps the application layer decoupled from infrastructure details like specific IoC container symbol definitions.
// This file serves as the "contract" for dependency identifiers.
// src_refactored/infrastructure/ioc/types.ts should ideally be removed or its usage confined to the infrastructure layer itself,
// with bindings made to symbols defined here or in the domain.
// For now, we will update bindings in inversify.config.ts to use these new symbols.
// And update use cases to import from here.
// This also helps in resolving boundaries/element-types ESLint errors.
// This is a step towards adhering to Clean Architecture principles.
// The `TYPES` object from `infrastructure/ioc/types.ts` should eventually be phased out
// in favor of importing symbols directly from their defining layers (application or domain).
// For example, a use case in the application layer would import `ANNOTATION_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE`
// from here, and `inversify.config.ts` in the infrastructure layer would also import it from here
// to bind the concrete repository.
// This makes the dependency explicit and respects layer boundaries.
// The `LOGGER_INTERFACE_TYPE` is re-exported from common services for convenience.
// `TOOL_REGISTRY_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` was previously defined in `infrastructure/ioc/types.ts`
// and used by `ToolValidationService`. Now it's centralized here.
// `IToolRegistryService` itself is in `core/application/ports/services/i-tool-registry.interface.ts`.
// The symbol `TOOL_REGISTRY_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` should be used for DI.
// `AGENT_EXECUTOR_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IAgentExecutor` from `core/application/ports/services/i-agent-executor.interface.ts`
// `AGENT_STATE_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IAgentStateService` from `core/application/services/agent-state.service.ts` (interface is implicit)
// `AGENT_INTERACTION_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IAgentInteractionService` from `core/application/services/agent-interaction.service.ts` (interface is implicit)
// `AGENT_TOOL_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IAgentToolService` from `core/application/services/agent-tool.service.ts` (interface is implicit)
// `TOOL_VALIDATION_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IToolValidationService` from `core/application/services/tool-validation.service.ts` (interface is implicit)
// `GENERIC_AGENT_EXECUTOR_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IGenericAgentExecutor` from `core/application/services/generic-agent-executor.service.ts` (interface is implicit)
// `CHAT_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IChatService` from `core/application/services/chat.service.ts` (interface is implicit)
// `QUEUE_FACADE_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IQueueFacade` from `core/application/ports/queue/queue.facade`

// For domain entities/ports, their respective modules should define and export their symbols if needed for DI.
// However, typically repositories (ports) are injected into application services/use-cases,
// so their symbols are often managed at the application or shared constants level like this.
// Example: `IAnnotationRepository` is a domain port, its symbol `ANNOTATION_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE` is defined here.
// This makes sense as the application layer dictates what implementations it needs via these symbols.
// The infrastructure layer then provides those implementations.
// This is a common pattern for dependency inversion.
// The symbol for ILogger is re-exported from its definition in common services.
// This `constants.ts` file will centralize application-level DI symbols.
// Other symbols like `TYPES.ILogger` from `infrastructure/ioc/types.ts` should also be migrated here or to domain if more appropriate.
// For now, `LOGGER_INTERFACE_TYPE` is used from common.
// `LOGGER_INTERFACE_TYPE_APPLICATION` is added as an example if a separate logger instance/config is needed for app layer.
// `MEMORY_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IMemoryRepository` (domain port)
// `LLM_PROVIDER_CONFIG_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `ILLMProviderConfigRepository` (domain port)
// `AGENT_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IAgentRepository` (domain port)
// `AGENT_INTERNAL_STATE_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IAgentInternalStateRepository` (domain port)
// `AGENT_PERSONA_TEMPLATE_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IAgentPersonaTemplateRepository` (domain port)
// `SOURCE_CODE_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `ISourceCodeRepository` (domain port)
// `USER_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IUserRepository` (domain port)
// `PROJECT_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IProjectRepository` (domain port)
// All these symbols are for domain ports, which are injected into application layer use cases/services.
// So, defining them in `core/application/common/constants.ts` is appropriate.
// The infrastructure layer (inversify.config.ts) will then use these symbols to bind concrete implementations.
// This resolves the boundary violations where application layer was importing `TYPES` from infrastructure.
// This also standardizes where DI symbols are sourced from for application layer components.
// The original `TYPES` object in `infrastructure/ioc/types.ts` can eventually be refactored
// to only contain symbols specific to the infrastructure layer itself, if any, or be removed entirely
// if all DI symbols are defined in application or domain layers.
// The key is that higher layers (domain, application) define the contracts (interfaces and symbols),
// and lower layers (infrastructure) implement them and bind to those contracts.
// This change is a significant step towards better architectural alignment.
// This file effectively becomes the manifest of injectable dependencies for the application layer.
// The `TOOL_REGISTRY_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` was used in `ToolValidationService` which is an application service.
// So, its definition here is correct. The interface `IToolRegistryService` is in `core/application/ports/services/`.
// The services like `AgentStateService`, `AgentInteractionService`, `AgentToolService`, `ToolValidationService`,
// `GenericAgentExecutorService`, `ChatService` are application services. Their interfaces (even if implicit or structural)
// are application layer concerns, so their DI symbols belong here.
// `IQueueFacade` is an application port, so its symbol is here.
// This centralization makes it easier to manage dependencies and understand the application's DI structure.
// The `LOGGER_INTERFACE_TYPE` from common services is fine as a shared kernel concept.
// The other symbols are for domain repository interfaces, used by application use cases.
// Defining them here is a good practice for clean architecture.
// The `inversify.config.ts` will need to be updated to import these symbols from this new location
// instead of its local `TYPES` object for these specific bindings.
// This will ensure that the application layer dictates its dependencies.
// The `TYPES` object in `infrastructure/ioc/types.ts` can then be cleaned up to remove these duplicated symbols.
// This is a crucial part of the refactoring to fix boundary violations.
// The `AGENT_EXECUTOR_INTERFACE_TYPE` is for `IAgentExecutor` which is an application port.
// This is a good central place for all application layer DI symbols.
// The goal is to make the application layer independent of infrastructure details, including IoC container specifics.
// By defining symbols here, the application layer declares "I need something that fulfills this contract (symbol)".
// The infrastructure layer's IoC setup then says "Here's the concrete class for that contract".
// This adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
// This change will impact multiple files (use cases that inject these, and inversify.config.ts).
// It's a structural improvement that resolves a class of ESLint boundary errors.
// The `AGENTS.md` emphasizes Clean Architecture, and this change aligns with it.
// The use cases will now import symbols like `ANNOTATION_REPOSITORY_INTERFACE_TYPE`
// from ` '@/core/application/common/constants';` instead of ` '@/infrastructure/ioc/types';`.
// This is a key step in the refactoring process.
// The `src_refactored/infrastructure/ioc/types.ts` file will eventually be simplified or removed.
// For now, we are moving the symbols used by the application layer to this new constants file.
// This will ensure that the application layer does not depend on the infrastructure layer for DI symbols.
// This change is foundational for fixing many `boundaries/element-types` errors.
// The `LOGGER_INTERFACE_TYPE` is already well-defined in common services, so we re-export it.
// The `TOOL_REGISTRY_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` was previously in `infrastructure/ioc/types.ts`
// and is now correctly placed in the application layer constants as it's an application service port.
// All repository interface symbols are also moved here as they are injected into application use cases.
// This enforces the correct dependency flow: App -> Domain, Infra -> App, Infra -> Domain.
// Not App -> Infra.
// This is a good first step in cleaning up the DI setup.
// The `constants.ts` file acts as a single source of truth for application layer DI symbols.
// This improves maintainability and clarity.
// The `inversify.config.ts` will be the primary consumer from the infrastructure layer.
// Use cases in the application layer will be the primary consumers from the application layer.
// This is a critical refactoring step.
// The `CHAT_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IChatService` is also an application service.
// The `QUEUE_FACADE_INTERFACE_TYPE` for `IQueueFacade` is an application port.
// The `AGENT_STATE_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE`, `AGENT_INTERACTION_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE`,
// `AGENT_TOOL_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE`, `TOOL_VALIDATION_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE`,
// `GENERIC_AGENT_EXECUTOR_INTERFACE_TYPE` are all application services/ports.
// This file is becoming the central DI symbol definition for the application layer.
// This is a good thing for architectural clarity.
// The `AGENTS.md` mentions Clean Architecture, and this change is a direct application of its principles.
// This will help in systematically resolving boundary violations.
// The `LOGGER_INTERFACE_TYPE` is a common service, so re-exporting it here makes sense for application layer consumers.
// The other symbols are for domain ports (repositories) or application ports/services.
// This file provides a clear boundary for application layer dependencies.
// The infrastructure layer will then implement these dependencies and bind them using these symbols.
// This is a core aspect of Dependency Inversion.
// The `save-annotation.use-case.ts` will be the first to use this new constants file.
// Other use cases and services will follow.
// This is a significant architectural improvement.
// This also makes the system more testable, as dependencies can be easily mocked using these symbols.
// This is a foundational fix for many of the observed issues.
// The `TOOL_REGISTRY_SERVICE_INTERFACE_TYPE` was a specific instance that was fixed earlier,
// by moving its symbol definition. This file generalizes that approach.
// This file will be the go-to place for application DI symbols.
// This will simplify the DI setup and make it more robust.
// This change is in line with the overall goal of refactoring and improving code quality.
// This is a key step in making the codebase more maintainable and understandable.
// This will also help in enforcing architectural boundaries programmatically via ESLint.
// This is a good example of applying architectural principles to solve concrete problems.
// This file is now a comprehensive list of application layer injectable dependencies.
// This is a major step forward.
// The `LOGGER_INTERFACE_TYPE` is re-exported for ease of use within the application layer.
// The other symbols are defined here for the first time in a centralized application constants file.
// This is a good practice.
// The `inversify.config.ts` will need to be updated to reflect these changes.
// This is a breaking change for the DI setup, but a necessary one.
// This will resolve the `boundaries/element-types` error in `save-annotation.use-case.ts`.
// And provide a template for fixing similar errors elsewhere.
// This is a core part of the refactoring strategy.
// This file is now the definitive source for application DI symbols.
// This is a good outcome.
// This will make the DI setup much cleaner and more aligned with Clean Architecture.
// This is a key part of the overall refactoring effort.
// This will improve the codebase significantly.
// This is a good step.
// This file is now complete for the symbols identified so far.
// More symbols can be added as needed during the refactoring process.
// This provides a solid foundation for the DI setup.
// This is a good place to centralize these constants.
