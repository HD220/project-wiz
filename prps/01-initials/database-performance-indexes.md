# Database Performance Indexes

## Executive Summary

Add strategic database indexes for frequently queried columns to improve application performance. Analysis shows several high-frequency lookup patterns that would benefit from proper indexing without over-indexing the database.

## Context and Motivation

**Missing Indexes Identified:**

**High-Frequency Lookups:**
- `accounts.username` - Used in every login operation
- `llm_providers.user_id + is_default` - Composite lookup for user's default provider
- `conversations.project_id` - Project conversation lists
- `messages.conversation_id` - Message retrieval in conversations
- `agents.user_id` - User's agent listings

**Performance Impact:**
- Login queries scan entire accounts table without username index
- Default provider lookups require full table scan
- Conversation and message queries become slower as data grows

**Current State:**
- Primary keys are indexed (SQLite default)
- Foreign key constraints exist but may not have optimal indexes
- No composite indexes for multi-column lookups

## Scope

### Included:

- Add index on `accounts.username` for login performance
- Create composite index `(user_id, is_default)` on `llm_providers` table
- Add index on `conversations.project_id` for project conversation lists
- Add index on `messages.conversation_id` for message retrieval
- Add index on `agents.user_id` for user agent listings
- Generate and test database migration for new indexes

### Not Included:

- Full-text search indexes (separate feature consideration)
- Indexes on low-frequency query columns
- Complex multi-table composite indexes
- Query optimization beyond indexing

## Expected Impact

- **Users:** Faster application response times, especially for login and conversation loading
- **Developers:** 
  - Improved query performance during development
  - Better application responsiveness as data grows
  - Foundation for scalable data access patterns
- **System:** 
  - Reduced database query execution time
  - Better resource utilization
  - Improved application performance as dataset grows

## Success Criteria

- Login queries execute 50%+ faster with username index
- Default provider lookups show measurable performance improvement
- Conversation loading times remain fast as data grows
- Database migration applies successfully without data loss
- Index usage verified in query execution plans
