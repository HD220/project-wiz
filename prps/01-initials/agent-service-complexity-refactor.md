# Agent Service Complexity Refactor

## Executive Summary

Refactor the complex `AgentService.create` method by breaking it into smaller, focused functions that follow the Single Responsibility Principle. The current implementation is 69 lines long and handles multiple responsibilities, making it difficult to maintain and test.

## Context and Motivation

The `AgentService.create` method in `src/main/features/agent/agent.service.ts` (lines 30-99) violates clean code principles:

**Current Issues:**
- **69 lines long** - exceeds recommended function length
- **Multiple responsibilities:**
  - Input validation
  - Provider verification
  - System prompt generation
  - Database transaction with multiple inserts
  - Error handling for various failure modes

**Maintenance Problems:**
- Difficult to test individual components
- Hard to understand business logic flow
- Changes require touching multiple concerns
- Error handling is scattered throughout method

This violates CLAUDE.md principles of "Small functions doing one thing well" and "One responsibility per function."

## Scope

### Included:

- Extract provider validation into separate method
- Create dedicated user creation method
- Separate agent creation logic from user creation
- Extract system prompt generation utility
- Implement proper error handling separation
- Maintain existing database transaction integrity
- Preserve all existing functionality and API contracts

### Not Included:

- Changing database schema or transaction behavior
- Modifying IPC handler interfaces
- Altering frontend integration patterns
- Adding new agent creation features

## Expected Impact

- **Users:** No direct impact - all agent creation functionality preserved
- **Developers:**
  - Easier to understand agent creation flow
  - Individual components can be unit tested
  - Simpler debugging when creation fails
  - Faster development of agent-related features
  - Reduced cognitive load when modifying agent logic
- **System:**
  - Improved code maintainability
  - Better error isolation and handling
  - Preserved transaction integrity

## Success Criteria

- `AgentService.create` method reduced to <30 lines as orchestrator
- Each extracted method has single, clear responsibility
- All existing agent creation functionality works identically
- Individual methods can be unit tested independently
- Error handling remains comprehensive and clear
- Database transaction behavior unchanged
