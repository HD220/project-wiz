## Implementation Strategy

### Evolutionary Micro-Features
Each task follows the **complete backendâ†’integrationâ†’frontend flow**:

1. **Database Schema**: Create/extend data models with proper relationships
2. **Service Layer**: Implement business logic with error handling
3. **IPC Integration**: Create handlers and API exposure
4. **Frontend Implementation**: Build UI components and state management
5. **Validation & Testing**: Ensure end-to-end functionality

### Micro-Task Subdivision Strategy

**Complex tasks (09, 10, 11, 12) have been subdivided into focused micro-tasks** to improve manageability and reduce cognitive load:

- **Foundation (A tasks)**: Database schema, core types, and basic service layer
- **Processing (B tasks)**: Business logic, integrations, and execution engines  
- **Interface (C tasks)**: Frontend components, user workflows, and monitoring

Each micro-task:
- âœ… Delivers complete, testable functionality
- âœ… Can be implemented independently within its group
- âœ… Follows clear dependency chains (A â†’ B â†’ C)
- âœ… Maintains 1.5-2.5 hour implementation timeframe
