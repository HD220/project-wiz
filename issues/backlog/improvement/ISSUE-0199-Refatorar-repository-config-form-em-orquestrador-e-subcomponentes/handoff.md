- Action: Refactoring and documentation of repository-config-form
- Justification: Enforced clean code compliance, modularity, and maintainability.

- Action: Refactored legacy hook `use-git-repository.ts` into specialized hooks (`use-git-repositories`, `use-git-status`, `use-git-branches`, `use-git-history`, `use-git-sync`) and async utility (`use-async-action`). Updated `git-repository-panel.tsx` to use new hooks. Removed obsolete hook file.
- Justification: Original hook violated clean code principles (excessive size, multiple responsibilities, high coupling, poor testability). Refactoring improves modularity, separation of concerns, maintainability, and aligns with project standards. All contracts documented in code comments (English, no JSDoc).

- Action: Refactored `src/client/hooks/use-history.ts` into modular hooks (`useConversations`, `useMessages`), extracted types to `src/client/types/history.ts`, and centralized API access via `IpcHistoryServiceAdapter`. All error messages standardized in English. Export utility extracted. All contracts documented in code comments (English, no JSDoc).
- Justification: Original hook violated clean code principles (excessive size, multiple responsibilities, high coupling, poor testability, mixed error messages). Refactoring improves modularity, separation of concerns, maintainability, and aligns with project standards. Hooks are now testable in isolation.
