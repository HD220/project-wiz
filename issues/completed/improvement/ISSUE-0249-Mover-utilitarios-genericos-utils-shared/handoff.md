# Handoff

**Issue:** ISSUE-0249-Mover-utilitarios-genericos-utils-shared  
**Type:** improvement  
**Status:** completed  
**Created:** 2025-04-12  
**Responsible:** code mode  

---

## Context

This issue was created to move all generic utility functions from `src/client/lib/utils.ts` to `src/shared/utils` in accordance with Clean Architecture principles and [ADR-0012](../../../docs/adr/ADR-0012-Clean-Architecture-LLM.md). The goal is to centralize reusable helpers and eliminate cross-layer dependencies.

## Progress Log

- **2025-04-12** — Issue created and added to backlog.  
  _Action:_ Initial description and traceability provided.  
  _Responsible:_ code mode

- **2025-04-12** — Analysis and migration executed.  
  _Action:_  
  - All functions in `src/client/lib/utils.ts` were analyzed for eligibility.  
  - The following functions were identified as generic and presentation-agnostic: `retryWithBackoff`, `formatDate`, and `formatDateTime`.  
  - These functions were moved to `src/shared/utils/utils.ts`.  
  - The function `cn` was retained in `src/client/lib/utils.ts` because it depends on `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` (UI/presentation concern).  
  - All project imports of the moved functions were searched; no references were found, so no import paths required updating.  
  - All code changes followed Clean Code and Clean Architecture principles, as well as project ADRs and SDRs.  
  _Responsible:_ code mode

- **2025-04-12** — Issue completed and moved to completed/improvement.  
  _Action:_  
  - All actions documented in this handoff.  
  - Issue folder moved to `issues/completed/improvement/`.  
  - Delivery finalized as per project standards.  
  _Responsible:_ code mode
