## Change Log

### 2025-04-12 — Code Mode (Roo)

- **Action:** Centralized and consolidated date utility functions.
- **Details:**
  - Added `formatDateTime` utility to `src/client/lib/utils.ts`, documented in English.
  - Ensured all date formatting logic is centralized in `utils.ts` (`formatDate`, `formatDateTime`).
  - Removed local `formatDate` implementations from:
    - `src/client/hooks/use-activity-log.ts` (now uses `formatDateTime` from utils)
    - `src/client/hooks/use-repository-settings.ts` (now uses `formatDate` from utils)
  - Updated imports and usage in all affected hooks/components.
  - Verified that all utility functions are documented in English, following project standards.
  - No changes were made to tests, in compliance with the task scope.
- **Justification:** Eliminated code duplication, improved maintainability, and ensured standardization and clarity as per Clean Code and Clean Architecture principles.
