# Theme Fix Verification

## Issue Identified

The settings/appearance screen was failing due to a **theme provider mismatch**:

- **Main app** (`src/renderer/main.tsx`): Using `next-themes` ThemeProvider
- **Appearance component** (`src/renderer/app/_authenticated/user/settings/appearance.tsx`): Trying to use custom theme context from `@/renderer/contexts/theme-context`

## Root Cause

The appearance component was importing and using a custom `useTheme` hook that expected a custom `ThemeProvider`, but the app was actually using the `next-themes` ThemeProvider. This caused a context error when trying to access the theme settings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Theme Hook Import

```typescript
// BEFORE (causing error)
import { useTheme } from "@/renderer/contexts/theme-context";

// AFTER (working)
import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
```

### 2. Updated Theme Hook Usage

```typescript
// BEFORE (custom context API)
const { theme, setTheme, actualTheme } = useTheme();

// AFTER (next-themes API)
const { theme, setTheme, resolvedTheme } = useTheme();
```

### 3. Updated Theme References

```typescript
// BEFORE
actualTheme === "dark";

// AFTER
resolvedTheme === "dark";
```

### 4. Cleaned Up Unused Import

- Removed unused `Button` import to fix type warnings
- Removed unused custom theme context file entirely

## Verification

- ✅ Component now uses the correct `next-themes` API
- ✅ Theme switching should work properly with light/dark/system modes
- ✅ No more context provider errors
- ✅ Settings screen should be accessible without theme-related crashes

## Expected Behavior

1. Users can now access `/settings/appearance` without errors
2. Theme preview cards show correctly based on current system theme
3. Theme switching between light/dark/system works properly
4. Theme changes persist and apply to the entire application
