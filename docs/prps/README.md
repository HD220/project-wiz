# Project Requirements & Planning (PRP) Documentation

## What is PRP?

**PRP (Project Requirements & Planning)** is a structured documentation system designed for **AI-driven software development** projects. It combines requirements documentation with actionable planning documents to facilitate effective LLM collaboration in development workflows.

## Purpose & Goals

### Primary Goals

- **Structured requirements capture** for complex software features
- **AI-friendly documentation format** that LLMs can easily parse and act upon
- **Incremental development planning** breaking complex features into manageable tasks
- **Historical context preservation** for development decisions and rationale

### Target Audience

- Development teams working with AI assistants
- Technical leads planning feature implementation
- LLMs providing development assistance
- Future maintainers seeking context on system evolution

## PRP Document Structure

### Core PRP Components

1. **Problem Statement** - Clear articulation of the challenge or requirement
2. **Technical Context** - Current system state, constraints, and architectural considerations
3. **Implementation Plan** - Step-by-step approach with phases and deliverables
4. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes and validation methods
5. **Risk Assessment** - Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

### Document Categories

#### `/00-miscellaneous/`

- **Concept documents** - PRP methodology and framework definitions
- **Base templates** - Standardized formats for different PRP types
- **Cross-cutting concerns** - Documentation affecting multiple system areas

#### `/01-initials/`

- **Initial implementation PRPs** - First-pass planning for major features
- **Refactoring PRPs** - Plans for improving existing code quality
- **Technical debt resolution** - Structured approaches to system improvements

## PRP vs Traditional Documentation

### Traditional Approach

```
Requirements → Design → Implementation → Documentation
```

### PRP Approach

```
Problem → PRP Planning → AI-Assisted Implementation → Validation
```

### Key Differences

| Aspect             | Traditional Docs                   | PRP Documents                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Timing**         | Often written after implementation | Written before and during development            |
| **AI Integration** | Not optimized for LLM consumption  | Specifically formatted for AI assistance         |
| **Granularity**    | High-level requirements            | Actionable, step-by-step plans                   |
| **Evolution**      | Static documents                   | Living documents that evolve with implementation |
| **Context**        | Limited historical context         | Rich context for decision rationale              |

## When to Create a PRP

### Ideal Scenarios

- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple development phases
- **System refactoring** affecting multiple components
- **Technical debt resolution** with unclear scope or approach
- **Architecture decisions** with long-term implications
- **Integration work** involving external systems or APIs

### Not Suitable For

- Simple bug fixes or minor feature additions
- Routine maintenance tasks
- Well-established patterns with clear implementation paths
- Emergency hotfixes requiring immediate action

## PRP Template Structure

### Standard PRP Format

```markdown
# [Feature/Component] PRP - [Brief Description]

## Problem Statement

- What problem are we solving?
- Why is this important now?
- What are the consequences of not addressing this?

## Current State Analysis

- What exists today?
- What are the limitations?
- What technical debt or constraints exist?

## Proposed Solution

- High-level approach
- Key architectural decisions
- Technology choices and rationale

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: [Foundation/Core]

- Specific deliverables
- Success criteria
- Dependencies

### Phase 2: [Enhancement/Integration]

- Build upon Phase 1
- Additional features
- Testing and validation

### Phase 3: [Optimization/Polish]

- Performance improvements
- Edge case handling
- Documentation completion

## Technical Considerations

- Performance implications
- Security concerns
- Scalability factors
- Maintenance overhead

## Risk Assessment

- Technical risks and mitigation
- Timeline risks
- Resource constraints
- Dependencies on external systems

## Success Metrics

- Quantifiable outcomes
- Performance benchmarks
- User experience improvements
- System reliability measures

## Related Documentation

- Links to relevant technical guides
- References to system architecture
- Dependencies on other PRPs
```

## Relationship to Technical Guides

### Complementary Documentation

- **PRPs** focus on **what to build and why**
- **Technical Guides** focus on **how to build it**

### Integration Pattern

```
PRP Planning → Technical Guide Reference → Implementation → PRP Validation
```

### Cross-References

PRPs should reference relevant technical guides:

- `/docs/technical-guides/ai-integration/` for AI-related PRPs
- `/docs/developer/` for implementation patterns
- `/docs/developer/architecture/` for system design decisions

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective PRPs

1. **Start with clear problem definition** - Ensure the "why" is well-established
2. **Provide sufficient context** - Include current state analysis and constraints
3. **Break down into phases** - Make implementation manageable and measurable
4. **Include specific success criteria** - Define "done" clearly
5. **Consider AI assistance** - Structure content for effective LLM collaboration
6. **Maintain traceability** - Link to related documentation and decisions

### Maintaining PRPs

1. **Update during implementation** - Capture learnings and course corrections
2. **Mark completion status** - Clear indication of implementation progress
3. **Preserve historical context** - Don't delete outdated information, mark it as superseded
4. **Cross-reference liberally** - Help future maintainers understand relationships

### AI Collaboration Tips

1. **Use structured headings** - Makes content easier for LLMs to parse
2. **Include code examples** - Provide concrete implementation direction
3. **Specify constraints clearly** - Help AI understand limitations and requirements
4. **Reference existing patterns** - Point to established architectural decisions

## PRP Archive Management

### Current State

- Active PRPs are maintained in their respective directories
- Implemented PRPs are moved to `/docs/archive/prps-implemented/` for historical reference
- Archive includes detailed implementation status reports

### Archive Strategy

1. **Move completed PRPs** to archive with implementation evidence
2. **Maintain active PRPs** in current locations with updated status
3. **Create clear navigation** between active and archived PRPs
4. **Provide implementation tracking** through status reports

### Recent Archival Actions (2025-07-29)

- **Database Column Naming Consistency** - Archived as implemented
- **Memory Service Complexity Split** - Archived as implemented
- **Design Implementation Plan** - Archived as superseded by current implementation

## Getting Started

### For New Features

1. **Assess complexity** - Determine if a PRP is needed
2. **Choose appropriate template** - Use standard format or adapt for specific needs
3. **Gather context** - Research current system state and constraints
4. **Plan iteratively** - Start with high-level plan, refine as understanding grows
5. **Collaborate with AI** - Use PRPs as structured input for development assistance

### For Existing PRPs

1. **Review current PRPs** - Understand existing planning approaches
2. **Identify gaps** - Find areas where additional planning would be beneficial
3. **Update status** - Mark completion state of existing PRPs
4. **Extract lessons** - Capture learnings for future PRP creation

## Evolution & Maintenance

PRPs are **living documents** that should evolve with the project:

- **Regular reviews** to assess relevance and accuracy
- **Updates during implementation** to capture learnings
- **Archival of completed PRPs** with clear historical markers
- **Continuous improvement** of PRP processes and templates

The PRP system is designed to grow and adapt with the project's needs while maintaining consistency and providing valuable context for both human developers and AI assistants.
