# Memory Service Complexity Split

## Executive Summary

Split the oversized `memory.service.ts` (400+ lines) into focused, single-responsibility services following the Single Responsibility Principle. The current implementation handles multiple concerns in one file, making it difficult to maintain and understand.

## Context and Motivation

The `src/main/features/agent/memory/memory.service.ts` file violates clean code principles:

**Current Issues:**

- **400+ lines long** - far exceeds recommended file size
- **Multiple responsibilities mixed together:**
  - Basic CRUD operations for memories
  - Complex search functionality with filters
  - Memory relationship management
  - Vector similarity calculations
  - Memory maintenance and cleanup

**Maintenance Problems:**

- Difficult to locate specific functionality
- Changes affect multiple unrelated concerns
- Hard to understand individual responsibility boundaries
- Testing complexity due to mixed concerns

This violates CLAUDE.md principles of "One responsibility per function/class" and "Small functions doing one thing well."

## Scope

### Included:

- Split into focused service classes:
  - `memory-crud.service.ts` - Basic CRUD operations
  - `memory-search.service.ts` - Search and filtering functionality
  - `memory-relations.service.ts` - Memory relationship management
  - Keep existing `memory-maintenance.service.ts` (already well-focused)
- Maintain all existing functionality and API contracts
- Preserve proper dependency injection patterns
- Update memory handler to use new service structure

### Not Included:

- Changing database schema or memory storage approach
- Modifying IPC handler interfaces or API contracts
- Altering frontend integration patterns
- Adding new memory features or capabilities

## Expected Impact

- **Users:** No direct impact - all memory functionality preserved
- **Developers:**
  - Easier to locate and modify specific memory functionality
  - Individual services can be understood independently
  - Simpler debugging when memory operations fail
  - Faster development of memory-related features
  - Reduced cognitive load when working with memory system
- **System:**
  - Improved code organization and maintainability
  - Better separation of concerns
  - Preserved functionality with cleaner architecture

## Success Criteria

- `memory.service.ts` split into 3-4 focused service files
- Each service has single, clear responsibility
- All existing memory functionality works identically
- Memory handler integrates cleanly with new service structure
- Individual services are <150 lines each
- Clear dependency relationships between services
