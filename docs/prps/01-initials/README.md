## ðŸ“¦ Archived (Implemented) PRPs

The following PRPs have been successfully implemented and moved to `/docs/archive/prps-implemented/`:

- **Database Column Naming Consistency** - âœ… Resolved: Consistent snake_case naming implemented
- **Memory Service Complexity Split** - âœ… Resolved: Service reduced from 400+ to 118 lines

See [Implementation Status Report](../archive/prps-implemented/implementation-status-report.md) for detailed analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Recommendations

### **Priority 1 - High Impact, Low Risk:**

1. **Service Layer CRUD Duplication Refactor** - Eliminates significant code duplication with zero breaking changes
2. **Database Performance Indexes** - Immediate performance benefits for growing dataset

### **Priority 2 - Code Quality Improvements:**

3. **Agent Service Complexity Refactor** - Service has grown to 380 lines, needs refactoring
4. **Database Timestamp Pattern Standardization** - Requires careful migration planning

## ðŸ“Š Current Impact Summary

- **Completed Improvements:** 2 PRPs resolved, ~300+ lines of complexity reduced
- **Remaining Active:** 4 PRPs for continued code quality improvements
- **Files Improved:** Memory service optimized, database naming standardized
- **Performance Gains:** Database indexing still needed for key queries

## ðŸš« Explicitly Excluded

Based on MVP phase requirements:

- **Test Suite Implementation** - Deferred until post-MVP
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Current patterns sufficient for MVP
- **Git Service IPC Integration** - Internal service, not user-facing
