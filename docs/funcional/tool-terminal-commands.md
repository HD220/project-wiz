# Agent Capability: Terminal/Shell Commands (TerminalTool)

Personas (AI Agents) in Project Wiz are documented to potentially utilize a TerminalTool to execute commands in the terminal or shell of the system where Project Wiz is running. This capability would be subject to appropriate security limitations.

## Intended Key Operations (as per initial documentation):

- **ShellCommand:**
    - Executes a specified shell command.
    - Returns the output generated by the command.

## Code Implementation Notes:
- **Status: Not Found.**
- No implementation corresponding to a `TerminalTool` was found in `src/core/application/tools/` during the code review.
- The `CreateProjectUseCase` does use `simple-git` to initialize a git repository, which involves shell command execution, but this is a specific, system-level action, not a general-purpose tool for agents.
- For agents to perform tasks like running build scripts, tests, or other command-line operations, a TerminalTool would be crucial. Its absence in the analyzed toolset is a significant gap for many development automation scenarios.
