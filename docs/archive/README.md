# Documentation Archive

This directory contains legacy documentation that has been superseded or deprecated but is preserved for historical reference and context.

## 📂 Archive Organization

### `/legacy-design/`

Design system documents that have been superseded by current implementation:

- **Design System Overview** - Superseded by current [Design README](../design/README.md)
- **Design System Specification** - Superseded by component-specific guides

### `/deprecated-technical-guides/`

Technical guides with deprecated patterns or approaches:

- Documents marked as "PARTIALLY DEPRECATED" or "NOT USED IN PROJECT WIZ"
- Guides that reference outdated patterns or libraries

### `/backup-files/`

Backup files created during documentation improvement process:

- `.backup` files from system improvements
- Temporary files that are no longer needed

## 🎯 Archive Purpose

**Historical Context Preservation:**

- Maintains decision rationale and evolution of the system
- Provides context for why certain approaches were abandoned
- Enables future reference for understanding legacy patterns

**Maintenance Overhead Reduction:**

- Removes outdated content from active documentation
- Reduces confusion about current vs. deprecated patterns
- Streamlines navigation and cross-reference systems

## 📋 Archive Guidelines

### When to Archive Documents

1. **Explicitly Superseded**: Documents marked as "legacy" or "superseded"
2. **Deprecated Patterns**: Guides marked as "NOT USED IN PROJECT WIZ"
3. **Duplicate Content**: Multiple versions where one is clearly outdated
4. **Backup Files**: Temporary files created during improvements

### Archive Metadata

Each archived document includes:

- **Archived Date**: When it was moved to archive
- **Superseded By**: Link to current documentation
- **Archive Reason**: Why it was archived
- **Historical Context**: Value it provides for reference

### Access and Reference

- Archived documents remain accessible for historical reference
- Links in active documentation point to current alternatives
- Cross-reference system updated to reflect archived status
- Search functionality includes archived content with clear labeling
