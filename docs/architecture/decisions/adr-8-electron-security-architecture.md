# ADR-8: Electron Layer Security Architecture

## Context
We need to reinforce the security of the Electron layer, following the guidelines in issue #327. This ADR outlines the architectural decisions for securing the Electron layer.

## Decision
The following architectural decisions are made to secure the Electron layer:

*   **Vulnerabilities to consider:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   Node.js Integration
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   GitHub Token Security
    *   Insecure API endpoints

*   **Security policies to define and implement:**
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP)
    *   Permissions Policy
    *   Regular Security Audits
    *   Dependency Management Policy
    *   Code Review Policy

*   **How to reinforce isolation and permissions:**
    *   Enable Context Isolation
    *   Use `contextBridge`
    *   Minimize Renderer Process Privileges
    *   Implement Input Validation

*   **Measures of cryptography to implement:**
    *   Encrypt Sensitive Data
    *   Use Secure Communication Protocols
    *   Implement Cryptographic Hashing
    *   Consider using a Hardware Security Module (HSM)

*   **How to perform an audit of dependencies:**
    *   Use a Dependency Scanning Tool
    *   Regularly Update Dependencies
    *   Use a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

*   **How to review the authentication and authorization flows:**
    *   Use a Secure Authentication Protocol
    *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    *   Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    *   Regularly Review Authentication Logs

*   **Integration considerations with existing systems:**
    *   Use Secure APIs
    *   Implement Input Validation
    *   Use a Secure Authentication Protocol

*   **Performance/scalability considerations:**
    *   Optimize IPC Communication
    *   Use Asynchronous Operations
    *   Offload Tasks to Worker Threads
    *   Cache Data

## Alternatives Considered
1.  Not implementing any security measures: This was rejected due to the high risk of security vulnerabilities.
2.  Implementing only a subset of the security measures: This was rejected because it would leave the Electron layer vulnerable to certain attacks.

## Consequences
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Improved security of the Electron layer
    *   Reduced risk of security vulnerabilities
    *   Compliance with security best practices
*   **Consequences:**
    *   Increased development effort
    *   Potential performance overhead

## Implementation Guidelines
*   Follow the security policies outlined in this ADR.
*   Use the `contextBridge` API to expose only the necessary APIs to the renderer process.
*   Encrypt sensitive data using appropriate encryption algorithms.
*   Regularly audit dependencies and update them to the latest versions.
*   Implement a code review process to ensure that all code changes are reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
