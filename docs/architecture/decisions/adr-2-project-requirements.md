# ADR-2: Project Requirements

## Context
The project aims to create a tool that assists in project management, automating tasks, facilitating collaboration, and providing insights into project progress. The tool will target software developers, project managers, and business analysts.

## Decision
The architectural decision is to adopt a modular and scalable architecture that supports the key features and functionalities outlined in the project requirements. This includes task creation and management, definition of requirements and acceptance criteria, prioritization of features, documentation generation, integration with version control tools (Git), real-time collaboration, and report and insight generation.

- Task creation and management module
- Requirements and acceptance criteria definition module
- Feature prioritization module
- Documentation generation module
- Git integration module
- Real-time collaboration module
- Report and insight generation module

## Alternatives Considered
1. Monolithic architecture
2. Microservices architecture
3. Serverless architecture

## Consequences
- Benefit: Increased efficiency in project management.
- Benefit: Reduced development time.
- Benefit: Improved software quality.
- Consequence: Potential complexity in managing multiple modules.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- Implement robust API integrations for version control tools.
- Prioritize security and data privacy in all modules.
