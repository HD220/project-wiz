# ADR-7: Adicionar validações infraestrutura

## Context
The project requires adding validations to the infrastructure so that the data is consistent and the system is robust against invalid data.

## Decision
Implement strict validations of types, formats, and limits at entry and exit points. Reinforce error handling to avoid exposing internal details. Create tests for valid and invalid scenarios. Update validation documentation.

## Alternatives Considered
1. No validations.
2. Weak validations.
3. No error handling.

## Consequences
- Ensures data consistency.
- Improves system robustness.
- Reduces the risk of invalid data.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Implement strict validations of types, formats, and limits at entry and exit points.
- Reinforce error handling to avoid exposing internal details.
- Create tests for valid and invalid scenarios.
- Update validation documentation.
