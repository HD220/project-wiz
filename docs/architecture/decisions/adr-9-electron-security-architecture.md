# ADR-9: Electron Layer Security Architecture

## Context
The application requires a robust security architecture to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and comply with relevant security standards and regulations.

## Decision
We will implement the following security measures for the Electron layer:

-   **User Authentication:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) using TOTP or WebAuthn. Password storage using Argon2id with unique salts. Consider using an identity provider (IdP) like Auth0 or Okta.
-   **Access Control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with clearly defined roles (Administrator, Standard User, Guest User). Centralized access control module to enforce permissions.
-   **Data Encryption:** AES-256 encryption for data at rest. TLS 1.3 or higher for all network communication. Key management using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a key management service.
-   **Auditing and Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all security-related events. Centralized logging system like ELK stack or Splunk for analysis and monitoring. Regular security audits.

## Alternatives Considered
1.  **Basic Authentication:** Considered but rejected due to security vulnerabilities.
2.  **Simple Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Considered but rejected due to scalability and maintainability issues.
3.  **No Encryption:** Considered but rejected due to compliance requirements and data protection concerns.

## Consequences
-   Improved security posture of the application.
-   Reduced risk of data breaches and security incidents.
-   Compliance with security standards and regulations.
-   Increased user trust and confidence in the application.
-   Potential performance impact that needs to be optimized.

## Implementation Guidelines
-   Implement MFA using TOTP or WebAuthn.
-   Use Argon2id with unique salts for password storage.
-   Implement RBAC with clearly defined roles and permissions.
-   Use AES-256 encryption for data at rest.
-   Implement TLS 1.3 or higher for all network communication.
-   Implement comprehensive logging of all security-related events.
-   Use a centralized logging system for analysis and monitoring.
-   Conduct regular security audits.
-   Optimize encryption algorithms and key management strategies to minimize performance overhead.
-   Use caching to reduce the number of authentication and authorization checks.
-   Monitor the performance of the application and identify any performance bottlenecks caused by security measures.
