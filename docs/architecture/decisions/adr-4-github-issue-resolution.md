# ADR-4: GitHub Issue Resolution Process

## Context

We need a standardized process for addressing and resolving GitHub issues to improve team coordination, code quality, and overall project efficiency.

## Decision

We will implement the following GitHub issue resolution process:

- **Triagem:** Issues will be triaged by the Product Owner or a designated team member to determine priority and impact.
- **Atribuição:** Triaged issues will be assigned to a team member with the appropriate skills and knowledge.
- **Desenvolvimento:** The assigned team member will develop a solution, adhering to project coding and architectural guidelines.
- **Teste:** The solution will be thoroughly tested to ensure it resolves the issue and doesn't introduce regressions.
- **Revisão de código:** A code review will be performed by another team member to ensure code quality and adherence to project standards.
- **Integração:** The reviewed and approved solution will be integrated into the main codebase.
- **Implantação:** The integrated solution will be deployed to a testing environment for validation.
- **Monitoramento:** The deployed solution will be continuously monitored for performance and stability.

We will use the following tools and technologies:

- **GitHub:** For issue tracking and management.
- **Project Management Tools (e.g., Jira, Trello, Asana):** For workflow management.
- **Communication Tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams):** For team communication.
- **Testing Tools (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Cypress):** For solution testing.
- **Code Review Tools (GitHub, SonarQube, Code Climate):** For code quality analysis.

We will coordinate the team using:

- **Daily Stand-up Meetings:** To discuss progress and roadblocks.
- **Kanban Board:** To visualize the workflow.
- **Clear Responsibilities:** Defined roles for each team member.
- **Open Communication:** Transparent communication channels.

We will leverage the following architectural patterns:

- **Layered Architecture:** To separate application responsibilities.
- **Microservices (if applicable):** To divide the application into independent components.
- **Event-Driven Architecture (if applicable):** To decouple components and improve scalability.

Performance and scalability considerations include:

- **Caching:** To reduce server load.
- **Load Balancing:** To distribute traffic across multiple servers.
- **Query Optimization:** To improve database performance.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** To identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## Alternatives Considered

1. Ad-hoc issue resolution process.
2. Using only GitHub issues without additional project management tools.
3. No code review process.

## Consequences

- Improved team coordination and communication.
- Enhanced code quality and reduced bugs.
- Increased project efficiency and faster issue resolution.
- Better application performance and scalability.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Create a Kanban board in our project management tool to track issues.
- Define clear roles and responsibilities for each team member.
- Establish coding and architectural guidelines.
- Implement automated testing and code review processes.
- Set up continuous monitoring for performance and stability.
