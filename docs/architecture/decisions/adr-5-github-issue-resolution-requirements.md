# ADR-5: GitHub Issue Resolution Requirements

## Context
We need to define clear requirements for resolving GitHub issues to ensure the stability, security, and usability of the application.

## Decision
We will prioritize issues based on the following criteria:
- Types of issues to prioritize: Critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, important feature requests, problems affecting a large number of users.
- Priority levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low.
- Criteria for urgency: Impact on user, impact on business, frequency of the problem, availability of alternative solutions.
- Expected response times: Critical (24 hours), High (48 hours), Medium (1 week), Low (2 weeks).
- Success metrics: Average resolution time, number of issues resolved, user satisfaction, number of issue re-openings.

## Alternatives Considered
1. No formal issue resolution process.
2. Ad-hoc issue resolution process.

## Consequences
- Improved stability, security, and usability of the application.
- Reduced user churn due to unresolved issues.
- Improved user satisfaction and engagement.
- Enhanced security and data protection.
- Increased efficiency of the support team.
- Faster time to market for new features.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Implement a clear process for identifying, prioritizing, and resolving issues.
- Ensure sufficient resources and expertise are available to meet the expected response times.
- Track the success metrics to measure the effectiveness of the issue resolution process.
