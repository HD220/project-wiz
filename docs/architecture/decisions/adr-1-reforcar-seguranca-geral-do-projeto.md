# ADR-1: Reforçar segurança geral do projeto

## Context
The project requires a comprehensive security overhaul to protect user data, provide clear security guidelines for developers, and equip system administrators with monitoring tools.

## Decision
Implement the following security measures across all project layers (Electron, Mobile, Backend, and Frontend):
- Security Policies: Define and enforce security policies for each layer.
- Privileged API Protection: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect privileged APIs.
- Secure Token Storage: Utilize secure storage mechanisms (e.g., hardware-backed keystores, encrypted storage) for tokens.
- Encrypted Communication: Enforce encryption (e.g., TLS) for all communication channels.
- Reinforced Validations: Implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks.

## Alternatives Considered
1. No security policies.
2. Insecure token storage.
3. Unencrypted communication.

## Consequences
- Improved security posture.
- Reduced risk of data breaches.
- Increased user trust.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Establish clear security policies for each project layer.
- Implement authentication and authorization for privileged APIs.
- Ensure secure storage of sensitive data like tokens.
