# ADR 327: Reforçar segurança geral do projeto

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The project requires a comprehensive security overhaul to protect user data, provide clear security guidelines for developers, and equip system administrators with monitoring tools.

## Decision

Implement the following security measures across all project layers (Electron, Mobile, Backend, and Frontend):

*   **Security Policies:** Define and enforce security policies for each layer.
*   **Privileged API Protection:** Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect privileged APIs.
*   **Secure Token Storage:** Utilize secure storage mechanisms (e.g., hardware-backed keystores, encrypted storage) for tokens.
*   **Encrypted Communication:** Enforce encryption (e.g., TLS) for all communication channels.
*   **Reinforced Validations:** Implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit and update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

## Consequences

### Security Requirements

*   Establish clear security policies for each project layer.
*   Implement authentication and authorization for privileged APIs.
*   Ensure secure storage of sensitive data like tokens.
*   Encrypt all communication channels to protect against eavesdropping.
*   Implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks.
*   Regularly audit and update dependencies to address vulnerabilities.

### Technical Feasibility

All proposed measures are technically feasible using well-established security practices and available libraries/frameworks.

### Potential Challenges

*   Ensuring consistent security policy enforcement across all layers.
*   Managing and rotating encryption keys securely.
*   Keeping up with the latest security vulnerabilities and patches.
*   Potential performance overhead from encryption and validation.

## User Stories

1.  As a user, I want my data to be secure so that I can trust the application.
2.  As a developer, I want to have clear security guidelines so that I can implement secure features.
3.  As a system administrator, I want to have security monitoring tools so that I can detect and respond to threats.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   All layers of the project (Electron, Mobile, Backend, and Frontend) must have defined security policies.
*   Privileged APIs must be protected against unauthorized access.
*   Tokens must be stored securely.
*   Communication must be encrypted.
*   Validations must be reinforced.
*   Dependencies must be audited and updated.
