# ADR 328: Adicionar validações infraestrutura

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The project requires robust infrastructure validations to ensure data consistency and system resilience against invalid data.

## Decision

Implement the following validation measures:

*   **Strict Input/Output Validation:** Enforce strict validation of types, formats, and limits at all entry and exit points.
*   **Reinforced Error Handling:** Enhance error handling to prevent exposure of internal details.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Create tests for both valid and invalid scenarios to ensure validation rules are effective.

## Consequences

### Security Requirements

*   Implement strict input validation to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
*   Enhance error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
*   Create comprehensive tests to ensure validation rules are effective and maintain data integrity.
*   Update validation documentation to reflect the implemented measures.

### Technical Feasibility

Implementing strict validations and reinforced error handling is technically feasible using standard programming practices and available validation libraries.

### Potential Challenges

*   Ensuring that validation rules are comprehensive and cover all possible invalid inputs.
*   Avoiding performance overhead from excessive validation.
*   Maintaining and updating validation rules as the application evolves.
*   Balancing strict validation with user experience (e.g., providing helpful error messages).

## User Stories

1.  As a developer, I want to add validations to the infrastructure so that the data is consistent.
2.  As a system administrator, I want the system to be robust against invalid data.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Entry and exit points must have strict validations of types, formats, and limits.
*   Error handling must be reinforced to avoid exposing internal details.
*   Tests must be created for valid and invalid scenarios.
*   Validation documentation must be updated.
