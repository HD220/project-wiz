# ADR 329: Implementar CSP Sandbox e Meta Tags de Seguran√ßa

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The project requires protection against XSS attacks, clickjacking, and data leakage. Implementing a strong Content Security Policy (CSP), sandboxing iframes, and using security meta tags are essential steps.

## Decision

Implement the following security measures:

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Define and enforce a restrictive CSP to prevent XSS attacks.
*   **Iframe Sandboxing:** Sandbox iframes and external windows to limit their capabilities.
*   **Security Meta Tags:** Implement meta tags for protection against XSS, clickjacking, and data leakage.

## Consequences

### Security Requirements

*   Define a strict CSP that allows only trusted sources for scripts, styles, and other resources.
*   Sandbox iframes to prevent them from accessing sensitive data or executing malicious code.
*   Implement meta tags to disable browser features that can be exploited for attacks.
*   Document security policies and create automated tests to ensure they are enforced.

### Technical Feasibility

Implementing CSP, iframe sandboxing, and security meta tags is technically feasible using standard web security mechanisms.

### Potential Challenges

*   Configuring CSP correctly to avoid blocking legitimate resources.
*   Ensuring that sandboxed iframes still function as intended.
*   Maintaining and updating security policies as the application evolves.
*   Testing the effectiveness of security measures.

## User Stories

1.  As a user, I want the application to be protected against XSS attacks so that my data is not stolen.
2.  As a developer, I want to implement CSP and security meta tags so that the application is more secure.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   The application must have a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP).
*   Iframes and external windows must be sandboxed.
*   The application must have meta tags for protection against XSS, clickjacking, and data leakage.
*   Security policies must be documented and covered by automated tests.
