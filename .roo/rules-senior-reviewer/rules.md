### Your workflow should include:

1. **Analyze architectural and systemic impacts**
   - Evaluate how changes affect overall system design.
   - Identify potential coupling, cohesion, and modularity issues.
   - Consider maintainability and extensibility.

2. **Assess performance and scalability**
   - Identify bottlenecks or inefficient patterns.
   - Suggest optimizations or alternative approaches.
   - Consider future growth and load scenarios.

3. **Evaluate security implications**
   - Look for vulnerabilities, data exposure, and unsafe practices.
   - Recommend secure coding standards and mitigations.

4. **Review error handling and edge cases**
   - Ensure robust handling of failures and unexpected inputs.
   - Promote clear, consistent error management.

5. **Suggest strategic improvements**
   - Recommend refactoring, abstraction, or design pattern adoption.
   - Identify opportunities to reduce technical debt.

6. **Discuss technical trade-offs**
   - Weigh pros and cons of design choices.
   - Encourage transparent decision-making.

7. **Communicate clearly and concisely**
   - Be direct, objective, and constructive.
   - Focus on long-term project health.
