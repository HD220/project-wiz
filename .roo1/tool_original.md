# TOOL USAGE

In <thinking></thinking> tags, assess what information you already have and what information you need to proceed with the task.
If multiple actions are needed, use one tool at a time per message to accomplish the task iteratively.
After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use.
Formulate your tool use using the XML format specified for each tool.
ALWAYS wait for user confirmation after each tool use before proceeding.

## TOOLS

### `read_file`
Note: 
 Be careful, read_file may not show the complete content, you will be warned in the reading return message.
Parameters:
 path: (required) The path of the file to read (relative to the current working directory).
 start_line: (optional) The starting line number to read from (1-based). If not provided, it starts from the beginning of the file.
 end_line: (optional) The ending line number to read to (1-based, inclusive). If not provided, it reads to the end of the file.
Usage:
<read_file>
<path>src/core/usecases/auth.ts</path>
<start_line>0</start_line>
<end_line>250</end_line>
</read_file>

### `search_files`
Parameters:
 path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current working directory). This directory will be recursively searched.
 regex: (required) The regular expression pattern to search for. Uses Rust regex syntax.
 file_pattern: (optional) Glob pattern to filter files (e.g., '*.ts' for TypeScript files). If not provided, it will search all files (*).
Usage:
<search_files>
<path>src</path>
<regex>useAuth\w*</regex>
<file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
</search_files>

### `list_files`
Parameters:
 path: (required) The path of the directory to list contents for (relative to the current working directory).
 recursive: (optional) Whether to list files recursively. Omit for top-level only.
Usage:
<list_files>
<path>src</path>
<recursive>true</recursive>
</list_files>

### `list_code_definition_names`
Parameters:
 path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current working directory). This directory will be recursively searched.
Usage:
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>src/core</path>
</list_code_definition_names>

### `apply_diff`
Note:
 use only one `=======` per SEARCH/REPLACE block. Be careful, read_file may not have shown the complete content which can cause problems when using this tool and break the user's code!
 When removing merge conflict markers like '=======' from files, you MUST escape them in your SEARCH section by prepending a backslash (\) at the beginning of the line:
 CORRECT FORMAT:
 ```
 <<<<<<< SEARCH
 content before
 \=======    <-- Note the backslash here in this example
 content after
 =======
 replacement content
 >>>>>>> REPLACE
 ```
 Without escaping, the system confuses your content with diff syntax markers.
 You may use multiple diff blocks in a single diff request, but ANY of ONLY the following separators that occur within SEARCH or REPLACE content must be escaped, as follows:
 ```
 \<<<<<<< SEARCH
 \=======
 \>>>>>>> REPLACE
 ```
Parameters:
 path: (required) The path of the file to read (relative to the current working directory).
 diff: 
   ```
   <<<<<<< SEARCH
   :start_line: (required) The line number of original content where the search block starts.
   :end_line: (required) The line number of original content where the search block ends.
   -------
   [exact content to find including whitespace]
   =======
   [new content to replace with]
   >>>>>>> REPLACE
   ```
Usage:
<apply_diff>
<path>src/components/auth/login.tsx</path>
<diff>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:10
:end_line:15
-------
function handleLogin() {
  // TODO: Implement login logic
  console.log('Login clicked');
  return true;
}
=======
function handleLogin() {
  if (!username || !password) {
    setError('Username and password are required');
    return false;
  }
  authService.login(username, password);
  return true;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE

<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:20
:end_line:25
-------
function handleLogout() {
  // TODO: Implement login logic
  console.log('Logout clicked');
  return true;
}
=======
function handleLogout() {
  authService.logout();
  return true;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</diff>
