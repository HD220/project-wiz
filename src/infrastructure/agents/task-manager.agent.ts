    // This is where the agent would use an LLM (e.g., via ai-sdk's generateObject or similar)
    // and provide `this.taskTool` (and other tools) to the LLM.
    // The LLM would then decide to call methods on `this.taskTool` based on the instruction.

    // For this step of the plan, we are *not* implementing the LLM call itself.
    // We are just showing that the agent has the tool and could use it.
    // The actual LLM call demonstration is in the next plan step.

    // Example: If instruction was "List jobs in queue 'abc'", the LLM (in a real scenario)
    // might decide to call `this.taskTool.list({ queueId: 'abc' })`.
    // The result of that tool call would then be returned to the LLM,
    // and the LLM's final response would become the result of this 'process' method.

    // Placeholder response for now:
    const simulatedLLMResponse = `LLM would process instruction: '${payload.instruction}'. TaskTool is available.`;
    console.log(`${this.name}: ${simulatedLLMResponse}`);

    // If the LLM successfully used a tool and a final answer is ready:
    // return { success: true, message: "LLM processed instruction using TaskTool.", details: toolCallResult };

    // If the LLM indicates it needs more steps or user input (not directly supported by this simple agent):
    // return; // This would re-queue the job as per current WorkerService logic.

    // For now, let's just return a simple string indicating the instruction was received.
    return `Instruction processed: ${payload.instruction}. LLM interaction not yet implemented in this agent.`;
