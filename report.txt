(node:53314) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///mnt/d/Documentos/Pessoal/Github/project-wiz/eslint.config.js?mtime=1752533405047 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /mnt/d/Documentos/Pessoal/Github/project-wiz/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
